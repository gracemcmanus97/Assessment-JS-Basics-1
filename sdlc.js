/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysis = "This is the second step, in which the software developer gathers all relevant information from stakeholders and analyzes this info to determine what will be feasible" 
const design = "This is where you create a design specification. The software development team works to make decisions about the overall build and function of the software solution"
const implementation = "In this fourth step, we take all previous steps and execute them"
const testing = "In this fifth step we execute the program to test all areas in order to identify any bugs, defects, or other issues."
const maintain = "This is the final step. This is where the program has been delivered and in use. You use all previous steps to keep code up to date in order for it to run smoothly."
